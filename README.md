## 🏢 About TGHI

**The Guiding Hand Initiative (TGHI)** is a youth-led organization based in Tanzania, founded to empower first-generation learners and marginalized youth — including teen mothers, orphans, and youth with disabilities.  
TGHI provides mentorship, digital and practical skills training, health awareness, and climate-conscious community engagement programs.  

Our work is rooted in empathy, integrity, and innovation — transforming lives through service that comes from the heart.  

> “We serve not for recognition, but because we know how it feels to lack support — and we choose to become the kind of help we once wished for.”  
> — *Barnaba Zakaria Madirisha, Founder & Executive Director*
